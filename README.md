## Zustand

[Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) is a state management library for React that aims to provide a simple and scalable solution. It is built around the concept of stores, which encapsulate a piece of state and provide methods to update and access that state. Zustand promotes a minimalistic and hook-based approach, allowing you to define and consume stores with ease.
